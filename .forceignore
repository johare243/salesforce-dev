# =========================================================
# CI-SAFE .forceignore (custom-package-only)
# Keep: custom objects (__c, __mdt), their layouts, code, LWC, flows, perm sets
# Drop: standard/managed apps, org-wide settings, reports/dashboards,
#       communities/site.com, flowDefinitions, profiles, etc.
# Order matters: broad excludes first, then selective re-includes (!) below.
# =========================================================

# ---------- User/org specific & non-portable ----------
**/profiles/*
**/profileSettings/*
**/networkBranding/*
**/companySettings/*
**/contentassets/*
**/RemoteSiteSettings/*
**/CallCenters/*
**/AuthProviders/*
**/NamedCredentials/*
**/EmailServicesFunction/*
**/ActionLinkGroupTemplates/*
**/InstalledPackages/*

# ---------- Platform/managed UI we don't deploy ----------
**/applications/standard__/**        # std apps (DataManager, FlowsApp, etc.)
**/appMenus/**                        # app switcher menu entries
**/ManagedContentType/**              # CMS managed content types
**/cms/**                             # any CMS artifacts
**/NotificationTypeConfig/**

# ---------- Org-wide settings (license/edition dependent) ----------
**/settings/**                        # re-include specific ones later if truly needed

# ---------- Communities/Experience (optional: enable later) ----------
**/experiences/**
**/siteDotComSites/**                 # (deduped: only listed once)

# ---------- Analytics/Reports (usually out of scope for core pkg) ----------
**/reports/**
**/reportTypes/**
**/dashboards/**

# ---------- FlowDefinitions (deploy Flows themselves, not version pointers) ----------
**/flowDefinitions/**

# ---------- Aura (if you only ship LWC; keep if you do NOT use Aura) ----------
**/aura/**

# ---------- Scratch-only cache/noise ----------
**/aura/*/aura_staticresources/*

# =========================================================
# Selective scoping: exclude broad, re-include only custom
# =========================================================

# Objects: exclude all, include only custom SObjects & MDT
**/objects/**
!**/objects/*__c/**
!**/objects/*__mdt/**

# Layouts: exclude all, include only layouts that belong to custom objects
**/layouts/**
!**/layouts/*__c-*.layout-meta.xml

# (Optional) Permission Sets: keep (remove the next line if you want to exclude)
# (No rule needed; by default we keep **/permissionsets/**)

# (Optional) Tabs: keep only custom tabs (uncomment to enforce)
# **/tabs/**
# !**/tabs/*__c.tab-meta.xml
# !**/tabs/*__mdt.tab-meta.xml

# (Optional) Custom Applications: keep only YOUR namespace/apps (commented by default)
# **/applications/**
# !**/applications/YourAppName.app-meta.xml

# =========================================================
# NOTES:
# - Flows under **/flows/** are allowed (we only ignore flowDefinitions).
# - LWC stays included (no ignore on **/lwc/**).
# - Profiles are excluded; use Permission Sets/Perm Set Groups instead.
# - If you truly need a specific setting/app, remove its ignore line
#   or add a targeted `!re-include` for that exact file.
